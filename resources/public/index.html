                    <p class="text-lg"><strong>We are a provider of technological expertise</strong> grown out of the consulting and development work of Arne Brasseur.

                        Our job is to find a path from a business need to a technical solution that ensures we can deliver quality and reliability within time and budget. To do so we are highly opinionated when it comes to choosing the software components we build on, and we work closely with customers to come up with pragmatic solutions that work.</p>

                <div class="my-4">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">We are a remote-first company</h3>
                    <p>Working on-line forces us to write things down, to document what we do. We default to communicating asynchronously, but use synchronous communication for its higher bandwidth when it makes sense.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="my-4">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">We value collaboration</h3>
                    <p>We encourage pair programming, seeking feedback, and working together to solve problems. Being remote-first makes it even more important to actively involve colleagues, to share knowledge, to be a team.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="my-4">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">People first</h3>
                    <p>Gaiwan is not a company that optimizes for profit above all else. Instead our goal is to meaningfully impact the lives of the people we work with, to remunerate them fairly, to allow them to work and live in a way that energizes them instead of draining their energy, and to work together with good people on interesting and challenging projects.</p>
                    <p>We value healthy, sustainable profitability because it allows us to provide these things.</p>
                </div>


                <div class="my-4">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">We work the system</h3>
                    <p>We value documented, repeatable processes. While the core of our work is unpredictable creative problem solving, a lot of what we do is recurring and mechanical. We want this mechanical aspect of our work to run like a well oiled machine, so that it gets out of our way, and we can maximize the space available for focused, creative work.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="my-4">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">We believe in synergy through community and open source
                    </h3>
                    <p>We actively support the community we come from, through the hosting and moderating of online spaces, the organizing of offline events, the active participating in existing fora and networks, and the direct contribution in the form of open source software.</p>
                    <p>This is the community that shaped us, and in terms we help shape this community to be open, welcoming, diverse, and active. We become who we are in and through interaction with others. Community is a non-zero sum game, and every investment we make in it tends to return multifold over time. This is where are future colleagues and clients are, where we forge connections and friendships, and where together we change the face of the industry.</p>
